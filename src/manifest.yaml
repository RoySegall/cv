  about: >
      I am a self-taught developer with a passion for UI/UX precision and a 
      drive for clean, intuitive design. I thrive on tackling complex 
      challenges, exploring emerging technologies, and sharing my journey 
      through blog posts. When I’m away from the screen, I’m usually in the 
      kitchen exploring new flavors and culinary techniques.
